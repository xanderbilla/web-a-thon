This is a project based on Health and Fitness where we track and generate user based data for their fitness and wellness. 


We have used On Dmand platform to run our backend application using agents and modified LLM. 


### Live on - [https://web-a-thon-ten.vercel.app](https://web-a-thon-ten.vercel.app) (make sure to run the [backend](https://github.com/rajvardhan05/webAThon-backend) locally)

## Getting Started

To clone and install Next.js, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Next.js project.
3. Run the following command to clone the Next.js repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/xanderbilla/web-a-thon
    ```

4. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned directory:

    ```
    cd web-a-thon
    ```

5. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```


6. After the installation is finished, you can start the Next.js development server by running:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and you can access your Next.js application at http://localhost:3000.

That's it! You have successfully cloned and installed Next.js. You can now start building your Health and Fitness project using Next.js.

# Challenges and Features

These routes are used to interact with the Health and Fitness project's API. You can use them to retrieve information about users, posts, and comments.

In the challenges, we successfully created 2 out of 3 agents for our Health and Fitness project. One agent is for chat, which helps in providing personalized recipes and suggesting foods according to health. The other agent is a barcode scanner, also known as "Know Your Food," which gives brief details about the scanned product. 

Unfortunately, we encountered a bug issue in the platform itself while working on the third agent, which took hours to debug. However, due to the delay, we had to skip implementing it for now. 

In addition to these agents, we have implemented basic functionality such as a blog.
